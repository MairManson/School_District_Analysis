# School District Analysis
Python 3.7 project to prepare school district's standardized test math and reading scores for analysis, reporting, and presentation to showcase trends in school performance that will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions on school budgets and priorities.

This project uses Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library to read raw data from CSV files, inspect and clean data, merge datasets, perform mathematical calculations, and visualize the data with charts and graphs.

Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district:
    A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
    An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
    Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
        Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
        The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
        The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
        School performance based on the budget per student
        School performance based on the school size 
        School performance based on the type of school
